# VueJS-Calculator
Made a calculator to practice working with VueJS

This was a small project just to re-familiarize myself with Vue 3. At the time of publishing, I'm currently working through an online course on Udemy that's oriented around all of the features of VueJS and Vue CLI.

VueJS is a Javascript framework that I used for a college project. The framework allowed me to quickly create re-usable components for a craigslist-style website for students at my school to list items that they were trying to get rid of quickly before moving out of their dorms.
